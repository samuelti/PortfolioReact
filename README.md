# React Portfolio

This portfolio is similar to the 02 assignment, however, it uses react to render all it's components.

New technology: react. React is a rendering engine for html that allows for websites to function more effectively and be more responsive with more options for input and rendering capability. Instead of moving to a new page, react can move around, add and remove components on the page.
